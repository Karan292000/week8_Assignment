# EYEBALL BOUNCING


Eye Movement Exercise

This project creates make some mouse movement in web page.
In JavaScript, events are actions that happen on a web page.
They can be anything from a mouse moving to a user typing in some text. 
Events happen to most elements on theÂ DOM. These events are a good way to bind a code to user actions. 

Mouse events are a popular way to bind the DOM elements to events. Some of these events are as follows:
*click: Triggered when the mouse is clicked
*mousemove: Triggered when the mouse moves over an element
*mouseleave: Triggered when mouse the leaves an element

In this project there are two eyes with balls when we move the mouse in anywhere on the webpage the eyeball should move the mouse direction.

In this project i have used external css and javascript file 
I have implement  for loop for moving more than one ball in a same way and same mouse move.
